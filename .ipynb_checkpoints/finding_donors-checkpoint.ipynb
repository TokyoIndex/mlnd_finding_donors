    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "The best models for this problem are models that deal with **_classification_** since we are trying to separate the data into two categories.\n",

    "- **Strengths:** A decision tree not only provides the solution for that case, but also states the reasons behind its choice. They are also able to find odd interactions and make minimal assumptions.  Finally, they are fast. [2](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics)\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** A decision trees main weakness is it can easily overfit to the data. Therefore, it is often a good idea to regularize the tree by, for example, setting a fixed max depth. [3](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-using-a-decision-tree-for-classification)\n",
    "- **Good Candidate:** The data has been divided into two categories, therefore a Decision Tree Classifier is well-suited to classify the data.\n",

    " - The [kernel trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) can be used to build expert knowledge about the problem through engineering the kernel. \n",
    " - SVMs are defined by a convex optimisation problem. The convexity property can make optimization in some sense \"easier\" than the general case – for example, any local minimum must be a global minimum. [5](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0ahUKEwis6OWFyInUAhURziYKHUyJCS8QFgg0MAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstats.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F24437%2Fadvantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm&usg=AFQjCNEHnwri-I77yXEZD_hOmMxkvh35ww&sig2=qZMg50ndey68-vD9nX2fmg)\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** SVMs are sensitive to noise since a relatively small number of mislabeled examples can dramatically decrease their performance.  Also, SVMs only consider two classes - so its good for classification, etc.  An additional weakness of support vector machines is their training time complexity which is between O(n²) and O(n³) in the worst case while using Sequential Minimal Optimization. [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_minimal_optimization)\n",

    "The best model for the job is the Logistical Regression model because it performs the best in generalizing to the classication problem. The training and prediction time are low and the accuracy and f-score are high in both the training and test set without any obvious shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the SVC model performed in a similar fastion to the Logistical Regression, it took the longest time to train and predict.  Therefore, chooseing Logistical Regression over SVM was obvious. Finally, while the Decision Tree model performed almost as good as the Logistical Regression model in terms of time and accuracy, it was apparent the the Decison Tree model did not generalize well as the F-Score on the test set was much lower than the coorspondng F-Score on the training set. This could be due to overfitting the model."

    "A logistical regression will draw a random line separating the data.  Then it will measure how badly the line separates the data by counting the number of errors or misclassified points. Next it will move the line trying to minimize the number of errors. Once it has correctly classified most or all of the points, the model is trained.\n",

    "The five features selected by the supervised learning algorithm are almost completely different than my selections, with the exeption of 'age'.  The first two, 'capital gain' and 'capital loss' were ignored in my predictions because I personally do have not any experience with capital gains/losses and did not understand how they correspond to earnings. Again, I neglected to consider that a married couple would have a higher income by combining their income.  Finally. I'm not sure of the difference between education number and education level. Education number must be a better predictor in this instance."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
